## Foreign Key Constraints

| Child Table         | Child Column   | Parent Table | Parent Column | On Delete | Relationship Type |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `products`          | `category_id`  | `categories` | `id`          | CASCADE   | Many-to-One       |
| `inventory`         | `product_id`   | `products`   | `id`          | CASCADE   | One-to-One        |
| `inventory_history` | `inventory_id` | `inventory`  | `id`          | CASCADE   | One-to-Many       |
| `sales`             | `product_id`   | `products`   | `id`          | CASCADE   | Many-to-One       |
| `revenue`           | `sale_id`      | `sales`      | `id`          | CASCADE   | One-to-One        |

### Constraint Details:

- **CASCADE**: When a referenced row is deleted, all related rows are automatically deleted

### Relationship Types:

- **Many-to-One**: Many child records reference one parent (e.g., many products per category)
- **One-to-One**: Exactly one child record per parent (e.g., one inventory per product)
- **One-to-Many**: One parent has many child records (e.g., one inventory has many history entries)

**Key Points:**

- APIs requiring Bearer tokens are accessible only after admin user authentication, i.e. login using `/v2/auth/login` endpoint.
- For detailed information on available parameters, refer to the `/docs` endpoint.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.7+)
- MySQL (v8+)

# Installation

- **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamibadd/forsit-ecommerce-apis.git
cd forsit-ecommerce-apis
```

- **Set Up MySQL**

- Ensure MySQL is installed on your system. If not, download it from [MYSQL Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/mysql/technologies/mysql-enterprise-edition-downloads.html) and complete the installation.
- Create a MySQL user and set a password if you havenâ€™t already.
- Open a terminal and connect to MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u your-db-username -p
```

Replace your-db-username with your actual MySQL username (e.g., root, ibad, etc.).

- Create the database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS forsit_ecommerce;
```

**Configure Environment Variables**

- Create a .env file in the project root and update the configuration:

Run the following command to populate the database with initial data:

```bash
DB_HOST = localhost
DB_USER = root
DB_PASSWORD = 9214s818
DB_NAME = forsit_ecommerce
JWT_SECRET_KEY = forsit_ecommerce
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30
```

Replace your-password with your actual MySQL password.

- **Populate the Database**

```bash
 mysql -u your-db-username -p forsit_ecommerce < populate_db.sql
```

Again, replace your-db-username with your MySQL username.

- **Install Dependencies**

Use `pip` to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Run the Application**

Navigate to the `app` directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd app
fastapi dev main.py
```

The `app` folder structure and project template are based on the official [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and the offical [FastAPI Full-Stack Template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/tree/master/backend) documentation.

Happy Hacking!
